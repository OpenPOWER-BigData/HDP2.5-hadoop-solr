Osama bin Laden was a son of the Saudi elite whose radical violent campaign to recreate a seventh-century Muslim empire redefined the threat of terrorism for the 21st century.

He was a new national enemy, his face on wanted posters, gloating on videotapes, taunting the United States and Western civilization.
