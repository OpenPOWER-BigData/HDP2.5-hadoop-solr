Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode. But as the ensuing week commenced I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures. And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman whom I had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town.
